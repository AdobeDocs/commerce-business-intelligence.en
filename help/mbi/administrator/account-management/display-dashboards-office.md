# Display Dashboards around the office

For  [!DNL MBI]  users who are interested in displaying their dashboards and reports on screens throughout the office, there are a number of hardware options that can easily enable this setup.

Here is the list of things you will need for the option we recommend:

1. **A television or monitor with HDMI input** to broadcast to.
1. **A wifi-enabled dongle running a lightweight OS, like [!DNL Chrome] OS or Raspberry Pi.** Your dongle should have an HDMI output that connects to your screen, and displays your selected dashboards at all times. A dedicated machine running its own OS will be superior to a setup like [!DNL Chromecast], where you would be limited to beaming the same dashboard to all connected screens. The dongle is best mounted behind your screen.
1. **A USB keyboard and mouse** to control your dongle.
1. **A browser extension to rotate between several tabs at once.** This allows you to set up any selected dashboards that you display in a unique tab. We recommend the [Revolver Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revolver-tabs/dlknooajieciikpedpldejhhijacnbda?hl=en) extension if you are using Chrome.

Once you have all of the hardware above, you can open a browser window on your screen with a specific dashboard that you want to display in each tab. Finally, configure your browser to rotate through each dashboard at the desired frequency.
