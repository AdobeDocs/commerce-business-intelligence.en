# Display Dashboards around the office

For [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] users who are interested in displaying their dashboards and reports on screens throughout the office, there are various hardware options that can easily enable this setup.

Here is the recommended list of things that you need for the option:

1. **A television or monitor with HDMI input** to broadcast to.

1. **A wifi-enabled dongle running a lightweight OS, like [!DNL Chrome] OS or Raspberry Pi.** Your dongle should have an HDMI output that connects to your screen, and displays your selected dashboards always. A dedicated machine running its own OS is superior to a setup like [!DNL Chromecast], where you would be limited to beaming the same dashboard to all connected screens. The dongle is best mounted behind your screen.

1. **A USB keyboard and mouse** to control your dongle.

1. **A browser extension to rotate between several tabs at once.** This allows you to set up any selected dashboards that you display in a unique tab. Adobe recommend the [Revolver Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revolver-tabs/dlknooajieciikpedpldejhhijacnbda?hl=en) extension if you are using [!DNL Chrome].

Once you have the hardware above, you can open a browser window on your screen with a specific dashboard that you want to display in each tab. Finally, configure your browser to rotate through each dashboard at the desired frequency.
