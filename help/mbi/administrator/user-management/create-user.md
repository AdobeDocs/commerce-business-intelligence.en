>The new user will not have any dashboards by default. We recommends that you [share](../../data-user/dashboards/share-dashboard-with-users.md) the necessary dashboards with the new user right away.

## Update your email address or password

You can update your email address and/or password by clicking on your company name in the top right-hand corner and then click **Edit Profile**.

## Resend the Invitation

If you need to resend the invitation to the new user, on the [login page](https://dashboard.rjmetrics.com), click the **Forgot?** link, enter the new user's email address, and click **Reset Password**. This will resend the invitation and allow the user to log in.
