1. Click on your company's name in the upper right-hand corner and select **Invite User** from the dropdown.
1. Enter the user's name and email.
1. Set the user's **general permission level**\: Admin, Standard, or Read Only.
1. Indicate if this new user should also be accountable for **billing or technical** issues by checking the appropriate boxes.
1. Click the **Save button**.
1. The new user will receive an email with login and password details.

**Important!** The new user will not have any dashboards by default. We recommends that you [share](../../data-user/dashboards/share-dashboard-with-users.md) the necessary dashboards with the new user right away.

## Resend the Invitation

If you need to resend the invitation to the new user, on the [login page](https://dashboard.rjmetrics.com), click the **Forgot?** link, enter the new user's email address, and click the **Reset Password** button. This will resend the invitation and allow the user to log in.
