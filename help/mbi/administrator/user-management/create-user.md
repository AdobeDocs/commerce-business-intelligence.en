# Add a new user

1. Click on your company's name in the upper right-hand corner and select **[!UICONTROL Invite User]** from the dropdown.
1. Enter the user's name and email.
1. Set the user's **[!UICONTROL general permission level]**: `Admin`, `Standard`, or `Read Only`.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To view, add, or change your account's billing information, you must have `Billing` permissions. [Permissions are set on a user-by-user basis](../../administrator/user-management/user-management.md) when user accounts are created. If you need `Billing` permissions, contact your account's administrator.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. The new user will receive an email with login and password details.

>[!NOTE]

>The new user will not have any dashboards by default. We recommends that you [share](../../data-user/dashboards/share-dashboard-with-users.md) the necessary dashboards with the new user right away.

## Update your email address or password

You can update your email address and/or password by clicking on your company name in the top right-hand corner and then click Click **[!UICONTROL Edit Profile]**.

## Resend the Invitation

If you need to resend the invitation to the new user, on the [login page](https://dashboard.rjmetrics.com), click **[!UICONTROL Forgot?]**, enter the new user's email address, and click **[!UICONTROL Reset Password]**. This will resend the invitation and allow the user to log in.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Each account has a contracted number of licenses, or seats. If you hit your limit or would like to know more, [submit a support ticket](../../guide-overview.md).
