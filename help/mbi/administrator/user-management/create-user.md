# Add a new [!DNL Adobe Commerce Intelligence] user

1. Click your company's name in the upper-right corner and select **[!UICONTROL Invite User]** from the dropdown.
1. Enter the user's name and email.
1. Set the user's **[!UICONTROL general permission level]**: `Admin`, `Standard`, or `Read Only`.
1. Indicate if this new user should also be accountable for **[!UICONTROL billing]** or **[!UICONTROL technical]** issues by checking the appropriate boxes.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To view, add, or change your account's billing information, you must have `Billing` permissions. [Permissions are set on a user-by-user basis](../../administrator/user-management/user-management.md) when user accounts are created. If you need `Billing` permissions, contact your account's administrator.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

The new user is sent an email with login and password details.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The new user does not have any dashboards by default. Adobe recommends that you [share](../../data-user/dashboards/share-dashboard-with-users.md) the necessary dashboards with the new user right away.

## Update your email address or password

You can update your email address and/or password by clicking your company name in the top right-hand corner and then click **[!UICONTROL Edit Profile]**.

## Resend the Invitation

If you need to resend the invitation, on the [login page](https://dashboard.rjmetrics.com/v2/session/create), click **[!UICONTROL Forgot?]**, enter the new user's email address, and click **[!UICONTROL Reset Password]**. This re-sends the invitation and allows the user to log in.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Each account has a contracted number of licenses, or seats. If you hit your limit or would like to know more, [submit a support ticket](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/mbi-service-policies.html).
