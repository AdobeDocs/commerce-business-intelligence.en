# Delete an [!DNL Adobe Commerce Intelligence] user

Users can be deleted by going to your account dropdown on the upper-right corner. Click **[!UICONTROL Manage Users]**, select the account you want to delete and click **[!UICONTROL Deactivate User]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Before you delete a user, you may want to check if there are any charts you want to keep. [!DNL Adobe Commerce Intelligence] support can share the user's dashboards with you, which allows you to save only what you need. Support can also push all the dashboards to your account, which transfers ownership to you. [Contact us](../../guide-overview.md#Submitting-a-Support-Ticket) for help.

## Reactivate a deleted [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user

You can reactivate the user by creating a user with the same email address. They get an email to create a new password, and their dashboards and settings are restored at login.

If you only need the dashboards from that user pushed into a different user's account, do the following:

1. Use the deleted user's email address to create a new [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user.
1. [Notify support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/mbi-service-policies.html) after you create the user. Support transfers the dashboards into your account.
1. After Adobe Support notifies you of the transfer, you can delete the user again.
