# Onboarding

The onboarding questions related to `store` and `database` settings ensure that we set up your reporting correctly. With these answers, we will deliver your reports that are precisely tailored to your store's setup.

## Store settings

-  *Does your store accept guest checkout?* - Select **yes** if you allow customers to make a purchase from your store without registering for an account.

-  `Timezone` - Select the `timezone` that you would like to see your reporting in.

-  `Currency` - Select the `currency` that your store operates in.

-  `Your week starts on...` - Select the day of the week that you would like to be the start of the week in your reports.

-  *Which version of [!UICONTROL Magento] do you use?* - Select the `currency` that your store operates in.

-  *Is your store based in the European Union?* - If you answer `Yes` to this question, we will host your Data Warehouse and all of your data in the European Union, in compliance with GDPR.

## Database settings

-  `Database name` - What is the *name of the MySQL database* where your [!UICONTROL Magento] transactional data resides?

-  `Table prefix (optional)` - Are the tables contained in your [!UICONTROL Magento] database prepended by anything (for example, `store_`)? This is not normally the case, but it is a customization that can be made.
