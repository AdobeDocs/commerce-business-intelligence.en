# Activate your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] Account for On-Premise Subscriptions

To activate [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] for on-premise subscriptions, first create a [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account, enter your settings information, then connect [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] to your [!DNL Commerce] database. <!-- For information about activation in `Cloud Starter` projects, see [Activating your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] Account for `Cloud Starter` Subscriptions](../getting-started/cloud-activation.md).-->

## Create your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account

   1. Go to your [[!DNL Adobe Commerce] account login](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login).

   1. Go to **[!UICONTROL My Account** > **My [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] Instances]**.

   1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Instance]**. 
       If you do not see this button, contact your Adobe Account Team or Customer Technical Advisor.

## Create your password

Once your account is created, you are sent an email from [!DNL "The Magento BI Team support@rjmetrics.com"]. Use the link provided to access your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account so you can create your password. Go to your inbox and verify your email address. If you did not receive an email, [contact support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/mbi-service-policies.html?lang=en).

After you create your account, you can add users to your new account. Admins can now be added using the **Invite User** option in your settings.

   ![](../assets/create-account-5.png)

1. Enter information about your store to set your preferences.

   There is some information you need to gather before you can connect your database. You need this information when completing the [!DNL **Connect your Database**] setup.

   ![](../assets/create-account-6.png)

## Create a dedicated [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user in the [!DNL Commerce] admin

[!DNL Commerce Intelligence] needs a permanent and dedicated user added to the [!DNL Commerce] project. This dedicated connection to [!DNL Commerce][!DNL  enables new data to fetch and transfer to the account's Commerce Intelligence] data warehouse. This user will serve as that permanent connection. 

A dedicated [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user is to prevent this user from being deactivated or deleted, thus stopping the [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] connection.

This user should also have a dedicated email address assigned. This is needed in the next step. Create this dedicated Commerce user at https://accounts.magento.com.

>[!NOTE]
>
>We encourage using a name to indicate its permanent status (e.g., ACI-dedicated, ACI-database-connector, etc.).
 
Finally, add the newly created user to the [!DNL Commerce] project's primary environment with a **Master** setting of `Contributor`.

   1. For **Encryption Type**, select `SSH Tunnel`.

   1. From the drop-down, copy the public key that is provided.

## Connect [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] to your [!DNL Commerce] database using an encrypted connection

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe strongly recommends you connect using an [`SSH tunnel`](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-ssh-tunnel.md). However, if this is not an option, you can still link [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] to your database using a [`direct connection`](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-a-direct-connection.md).

Enter your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] information in the [!UICONTROL Connect your Magento Database] screen.

   ![](../assets/connect-magento-db.png)

   Inputs:

   [!UICONTROL Integration Name]:  [choose a name for your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] instance]
   
   [!UICONTROL Host]: `mbi.internal`
   
   [!UICONTROL Port]: `3306`

   [!UICONTROL Username]: `mbi`

   [!UICONTROL Password]: [input password displayed in the previous section]

   [!UICONTROL Database Name]: `main`

   [!UICONTROL Table Prefixes]: [leave blank if there are no table prefixes]

Next, you must set your [!UICONTROL **Time Zone**] settings.

   ![](../assets/time-zone-settings.png)

   Inputs:

   [!UICONTROL Database Timezone]: `UTC`

   [!UICONTROL Desired Timezone]: [choose the time zone for which you want your data to display]

Next, you must get your encryption settings information.

    The project UI provides an SSH access string. This string can be used for gathering the information needed for the [!UICONTROL **Remote Address**] and [!UICONTROL **Username**] in setting up your [!UICONTROL **Encryption**] settings. Use the SSH Access string by clicking the access site button on your Master branch of your Project UI and find your [!UICONTROL User Name] and [!UICONTROL Remote Address] as shown below.
    
       ![](../assets/master-branch-settings.png)

Next, input your [!DNL Encryption] settings.

      ![](../assets/encryption-settings-2.png)

    Inputs:

    [!UICONTROL Encryption Type]: `SSH Tunnel`

    [!UICONTROL Remote Address]: `ssh.us-3.magento.cloud`  [from the previous step]

    [!UICONTROL Username]: `vfbfui4vmfez6-master-7rqtwtiâ€”mymagento`  [from the previous step] 

    [!UICONTROL Port]: `22`

You can now save your integration. Click [!UICONTROL **Save Integration**].

    You have now successfully connected your [!DNL Commerce] database to your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account.

>[!NOTE]

>If you are a Magento BI Pro customer, contact your Customer Success Manager or Customer Technical Advisor to coordinate the next steps.

When you finish configuration, you can [sign in](../getting-started/sign-in.md) to your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account.
