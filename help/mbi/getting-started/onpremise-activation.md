## Create a dedicated [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user in the [!DNL Commerce] admin

To use [!DNL Commerce Intelligence], you must add a permanent and dedicated user to the [!DNL Commerce] project. This dedicated user serves as a permanent connection to [!DNL Commerce] that enables the fetch and transfer of new data to the account's [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] Data Warehouse.

Configuring a dedicated [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user ensures that the account is not deactivated or deleted, thus stopping the [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] connection.


>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe encourages using a name to indicate its permanent status (e.g., ACI-dedicated, ACI-database-connector, and so forth).
 
After you created the dedicated user  for [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] in the Admin, add the same user to the primary environment of the [!DNL Commerce] project with a **[!UICONTROL Master]** setting of `Contributor`.

However, if this method is not an option, you can still link [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] to your database using a [`direct connection`](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-a-direct-connection.md).
