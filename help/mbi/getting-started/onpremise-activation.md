# Activate your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] Account for On-Premise and Starter Subscriptions

To activate [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] for on-premise subscriptions, first create a [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account, enter your settings information, then connect [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] to your [!DNL Commerce] database. <!-- For information about activation in `Cloud Starter` projects, see [Activating your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] Account for `Cloud Starter` Subscriptions](../getting-started/cloud-activation.md).-->

## Create your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account

To create your account, contact your Adobe Account Team or Customer Technical Advisor.

After your account has been created, check your email for an account notification email from [!DNL The Magento BI Team@rjmetrics.com]. Use the link provided in the email to access your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account and create your password. Go to your inbox and verify your email address. 

If you did not receive an email, [contact support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/mbi-service-policies.html?lang=en).

## Add [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] users

After you set your password and log into [!DNL Commerce Intelligence], you can add other users to your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account. When adding users, add admin users with appropriate permissions to complete the activation process.

   ![Add user form with email address and permission level fields](../assets/create-account-5.png)

## Create a dedicated [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user in the [!DNL Commerce] admin

To use [!DNL Commerce Intelligence], you must add a permanent and dedicated user to the [!DNL Commerce] project. This dedicated user serves as a permanent connection to [!DNL Commerce] that enables the fetch and transfer of new data to the account's [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] Data Warehouse.

Configuring a dedicated [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] user ensures that the account is not deactivated or deleted, thus stopping the [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] connection.


>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe encourages using an account name that indicate its permanent status (e.g., ACI-dedicated, ACI-database-connector, and so forth).

After you created the dedicated user for [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] in the Admin, add the same user to the primary environment of the [!DNL Commerce] project with a **[!UICONTROL Master]** setting of `Contributor`.

   ![Commerce add user interface with role set to Contributor](../assets/commerce-add-user-settings.png)

>Adobe strongly recommends that you use an [`SSH tunnel`](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-ssh-tunnel.md) tunnel to make the database connection. However, if this method is not an option, you can still link [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] to your database using a [`direct connection`](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-a-direct-connection.md).

Enter your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] information in the [!UICONTROL Connect your Magento Database] screen.

   **Inputs:**

   [!UICONTROL Database Timezone]: `UTC`

   [!UICONTROL Desired Timezone]: [choose the time zone for which you want your data to display]

## Get your encryption settings information

The project UI provides an SSH access string. This string can be used for gathering the information needed for the [!UICONTROL **Remote Address**] and [!UICONTROL **Username**]. Use the SSH Access string by selecting the access site button on the Master branch of the Project UI. Then, find your [!UICONTROL User Name] and [!UICONTROL Remote Address] as shown below.

[!UICONTROL Port]: `22`

## Save your integration.

After completing the configuration steps, apply the changes by selecting [!UICONTROL **Save Integration**].

You have now successfully connected your [!DNL Commerce] database to your [!DNL Commerce Intelligence] account.
