For help activating MBI for Cloud Pro projects, contact your Magento Customer Success Manager or Customer Technical Advisor.

1. Create your MBI Account.

    - Go to [https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login)

    - Go to **My Account** â†’ **My MBI Instances**.

    - Click the **Create Instance**. If you do not see this button, contact your Customer Success Manager or Customer Technical Advisor.

    - Select your Cloud Starter subscription. If you only have a cloud starter subscription this will automatically be selected.

    - Click **Continue**.

    - Input your information to create your account.

     ![Picture5.png](../../assets/Picture5.png)

1. Input information about your store to set your preferences.

    ![Picture6.png](../../assets/Picture6.png)

    There is some information you need to gather before you can connect your database for the third step in the onboarding flow. You will be filling in the **Connect your database** page in Step **9**.

1. Create dedicated MBI User.

    - Create a new user on [https://accounts.magento.com](https://accounts.magento.com).

    - _Why a new user?_ MBI needs a user added to the project to continuously fetch new data to be transferred to the account's MBI data warehouse. This user will serve as that connection. Adding this user to the project will come in Step **4**.

    - The reason for having a dedicated MBI user is to prevent the added user from inadvertently being deactivated or deleted and stopping the MBI connection.

1. Add the newly created user to the project's primary environment as a `Contributor`.

1. Get your MBI SSH keys.

    - Go to the **Connect your database** page of the MBI set up user interface and scroll down to **Encryption settings**.

    - For the field **Encryption Type** chose **SSH Tunnel**.

    - From the dropdown, you can copy and paste the provided MBI Public Key.

    ![Picture8.png](../../assets/Picture8.png)

1. Add your new MBI Public key to the MBI user created in Step **5**.

    - Go to [https://accounts.magento.cloud/](https://accounts.magento.cloud/). Sign in with your account log in information for the new MBI user created. Then go to the **Account Settings** tab.

    - Scroll down the page and expand the dropdown for SSH keys. Then click **Add a public key**.

1. Provide MBI MySQL credentials.

    - Update your `.magento/services.yaml`

    ```sql
    mysql:
        type: mysql:10.0
        disk: 2048
        configuration:
            schemas:
                - main
            endpoints:
                mysql:
                    default_schema: main
                    privileges:
                        main: admin
                mbi:
                    default_schema: main
                    privileges:
                        main: ro
    ```

    - Update your `.magento.app.yaml`

    ```sql
            relationships:
                database: "mysql:mysql"
                mbi: "mysql:mbi"
                redis: "redis:redis"
    ```

1. Get information for connecting your database to MBI.

    Run

    to get information on connecting your database.

    You should receive information similar to the output below:

    ```json
