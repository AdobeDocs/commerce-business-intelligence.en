zendesk_id: 360016731451

Only users with [Admin permissions](../../administrator/user-management/user-management.md){: target="_blank"} have the ability to create and edit SQL charts. Standard users can rearrange these charts on dashboards, and Read-only users will have the same experience they do with traditional charts. In addition, Read-only users wonâ€™t have access to the text of the query.
