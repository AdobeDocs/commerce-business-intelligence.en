# Cohort Report Builder

Have you ever wanted to study how different subsets of your users behave over time? For example, ever wondered if users who register during a promo period have a higher average lifetime revenue than those who do not? If the answer is `Yes`, then the `Cohort Report Builder` is the perfect tool for you. [!DNL MBI] is optimized to perform this analysis and make it relevant to your business.

## What is cohort analysis? {#what}

`Cohort` analysis can be broadly defined as the analysis of user groups that share similar characteristics over their life cycles. It allows you to identify behavioral trends across different user groups.

For a more in-depth primer on `cohort` analysis, [look here](https://www.cohortanalysis.com/).

In your [!DNL MBI] dashboard, it is easy to create user `cohorts` based on a `cohort` date and a metric in your account.

## Well, why is cohort analysis important? {#important}

As mentioned above, `cohort` analysis allows you to identify behavioral trends among different user groups. With a solid understanding of how certain groups behave, you can tailor your decisions and spending to maximize your sales. Take, for example, a lifetime revenue `cohort` analysis - while this kind of analysis is beneficial for many reasons, the immediate one is better customer acquisition decisions.

## How do I create my own `cohort` analysis?

### New Architecture

These are the instructions for using the `Cohort Report Builder` on the [New Architecture](../../administrator/account-management/new-architecture.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Report Builder]** on the left tab or **[!UICONTROL Add Report** > **Create Report]** in any dashboard.

1. In the `Report Builder` selection screen, click **[!UICONTROL Create Report]** next to the `Visual Report Builder` option.

**Adding a Metric**

Now that you are in the `Report Builder`, add the metric that you want to perform the analysis on (example: `Revenue` or `Orders`).

>[!NOTE] 
>
>Native [!DNL Google Analytics] metrics are not compatible with the `Cohort Report Builder`.

**Toggle the Metric View to `Cohort`**

![](../../assets/visual-report-builder-cohort-toggle.png)

This opens up a new window to configure the details of the `Cohort` Report.

### Five specifications are needed to build a `Cohort` report:

1. How to group the `cohorts`
1. The `cohort` time period
1. The number of `cohorts` to view
1. The minimum amount of data each `cohort` must contain
1. Time range after `cohort` occurrence

#### 1. Grouping `cohorts`

`Cohorts` are grouped by a timestamp, like **registration date** or **first order date**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You cannot use the same timestamp that the metric is built on for the `cohort` date. For an analysis that requires this, you can use the `Standard report builder` instead.

#### 2. `Cohort` time period

Choose the time period to group `cohorts` by. In other words, which part of the timestamp that you selected above is most important; the `week`, `month`, `quarter`, or `year`? Your report displays data in whatever interval that you select here

#### 3. and 4. Set the number of `cohorts` to view and how much data each `cohort` must have

These parameters help you view only the `cohorts` that you are interested in, and the handy `Preview` box at the bottom of the window shows you exactly what cohorts display in your report.

By default, the current `cohort` is not included unless you change the minimum amount of data required for each `cohort` to `0`. In this case, the `cohort` for the current time period includes only partial data.

#### 5. Time Range After `Cohort` Occurrence

This feature allows you to set the time range of data that you view for the selected `cohorts`. For example, if you want to view 24 monthly `cohorts` based on `customer's first order date`, but you are only interested in the first 3 months of data for each `cohort`, you can set the `number of cohorts to view` to `24` and the `time range after cohort occurrence` to `3`.

The interval for this value changes with whatever you selected in the `cohort time period` and the value is set to `12` by default; the value does not change unless you click on the calendar icon to edit it.

#### Other notes

* [!UICONTROL Filters]: applied to your metrics remain intact when you toggle between `Standard` and `Cohort` views.

* See [`Perspectives`](#perspectives).

#### Example

Here is an example to pull it all together. In this example, I want to check out order behavior after a `cohort`'s first purchase to see if that cohort is coming back to make repeat purchases in the next six months.

### Legacy Architecture

#### Legacy Architecture {#personalinfo}

Below are instructions specific to the legacy version of the `Cohort Report Builder`. If you are interested in using the new version, see [New Architecture](../../administrator/account-management/new-architecture.md) for more information about migrating to an [!DNL MBI] New Architecture account.

#### How do I create my own `cohort` analysis? {#create}

![](../../assets/create-cohort-analysis.png)

`Cohort` analysis in action! Here, you can see revenue growing over time on a cumulative and per-user basis.

This section walks you through creating your own `cohort` analysis. For examples (and animated GIFs demonstrating the process), look at the [Examples section](#examples) of this article.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Report Builder]** on the left tab or **[!UICONTROL Add Report** > **Create Report]** in any dashboard.

1. In the `Report Builder Selection` screen, click **[!UICONTROL Create Report]** next to the `Cohort Analysis` option.

#### Adding a metric

Now that you are in the `Cohort Report Builder`, add the metric (example: `Revenue` or `Number of orders`) on which you want to perform the analysis.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Native [!DNL Google Analytics] metrics are not compatible with the `Cohort Report Builder`.

#### Selecting the cohort date {#date}

The next step is to specify the `cohort date`. This is the date by which your users are grouped. For example, this might be `User's first order date` or `User's registration date`.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot use the same date the metric is built on (example: `created at`) as the `cohort date`.

#### Setting the interval and time period

Next, set the `Interval` and `Time Period`.

`Interval`
The `Interval` option allows you to set the `length` of your `cohorts`. For example, if this is set to `Month`, your report is measured in months.

You can change how these intervals are displayed on the x-axis using the **Duration** menu.

`Time Period`
Use the `Time Period` menu to choose the specific user `cohorts` to analyze. You can show every `cohort`, choose from a list, specify a time range, or define a rolling time range of `cohorts` to include. For example, if you used the `Specific Cohorts` option, you can select specific months to include in the analysis:

![Using the `Time Period` menu to add Specific `Cohorts`](../../assets/Cohort_Time_Period.gif)

If you are grouping you `cohorts` by registration date and then selected April, May, and June in the `Specific Cohorts` list, any users who registered in those months would be included.

#### Defining the X-axis

Under `duration`, you can define the chart's X-axis settings. That is, how many time periods each data point represents and how many data points to include in the analysis.

#### Selecting the `counting members` table

If you opted to group users by a `cohort date` that has been joined from another table, you may see a `counting members in the â€¦ table` option.

![](../../assets/Cohort_Counting_Members_option.png)

Let us look at an example to understand this setting. Suppose you built a report cohorting a `Revenue` metric by `Customer's registration date`. You also wanted to use the perspective `Average value per cohort member` to see the revenue per buyer over time. To find the average value per buyer, you need to decide on the number of buyers to divide by. Is it the number of registered customers in your `customers` table, or is it the number of distinct buyers in your `orders table` for the same period?

This setting answers that question. Counting members in the `customers` table includes all customers (whether they made a purchase, ever) in the average. Counting members in the `orders` table includes only customers who made a purchase.

#### Selecting a perspective {#perspective}

After you have defined the metric and how you want to analyze it, you can select the `perspective` you want to use.

Just above the report visualization is a dropdown of `perspective` settings.

See [Perspectives](#perspectives).

## Examples of cohort analysis {#examples}

Now that you have gone through how to create a `cohort` analysis, look at some examples.

### I want to know how my user `cohorts` are growing over time.

![User `cohorts` growing over time](../../assets/cohort1.gif)

In this example, you analyzed the `Revenue` metric, grouped your cohorts by the `customer's first order date`, and selected the 8 most recent `cohorts` (defined in the `Time Period` menu) to include in the analysis. To see how the cohorts grew over time, you used the `Cumulative Average Value per Cohort Member` `perspective`.

### I want to know, on average, how many orders a user makes at different points in their lifetime.

![Average number of orders users make at different points in their lifetimes](../../assets/cohort2.gif

For this example, you analyzed the `Number of orders` metric, grouped your cohorts by the `customer's first order date`, and included the eight most recent cohorts (defined in the `Time Period` menu) in the analysis. To see the average number of orders for each cohort, you changed the `perspective` to `Average Value per Cohort Member`.

### I want to understand how a user's future purchasing activity compares to their first month's activity with the business.

![Comparing a user's future purchasing activity to their first month of activity](../../assets/cohort3.gif)

## `Perspectives` {#perspectives}

`Standard`
This shows the incremental contribution of a given cohort group at any given point in their life cycle. (example: The "Week 6" point displays all data points made by users in their sixth week.)

`Average Value per Cohort Member`
This divides the `Standard cohort` analysis in (1) by the number of users in each `cohort` group. This can be useful for comparing cohort performances on an apples-to-apples basis, as not all cohort groups may include the same number of users. For example, the average week 6 revenue per user from a certain `cohort`.

`Cumulative`
This `perspective` shows the traditional `cohort` analysis on a `cumulative` basis. In other words, it shows the total contribution of a given cohort to date at any given point in their life cycle. For example, the cumulative revenue after six weeks of users from a certain cohort.

`Cumulative Average Value per Cohort Member`
This divides the `Cumulative` analysis in (3) by the number of users in each `cohort` group. It shows the average lifetime contribution (often average lifetime revenue) per `cohort` member at each period in the `cohort's` life. For example, the average lifetime revenue after six months of users that joined in June.

`Percent of First Value (show first value)`
This analyzes the aggregate `cohort` contribution at a specific time in a `cohort's` life cycle as a percentage of their contribution in the first period. For example, the month 6 revenue divided by the month 1 revenue of users that joined in June.

`Percent of First Value (hide first value)`
This is the same as the `perspective` above, except that the first time period value of 100% is hidden.

## Wrapping up {#finish}

The `Cohort Report Builder` is optimized for grouping users by a common `cohort date`. You might be interested in grouping the users by a similar activity or attribute. Adobe recommends checking out [this tutorial on qualitative cohorts](../dev-reports/create-qual-cohort-analysis.md) to get started.
