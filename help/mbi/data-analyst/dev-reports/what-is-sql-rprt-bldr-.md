[The SQL Report Builder](../data-analyst/dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.md) is a feature that gives SQL-savvy Magento BI users a way to directly run queries against the PostgreSQL data warehouse that powers their dashboards. Remember when you had to wait for a full update to complete before you could use the new calculated column or join you created?

Those days are gone - with the [SQL Report Builder](../data-analyst/dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.md), you can run a quick SQL query and get your data now.
