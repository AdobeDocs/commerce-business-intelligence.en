The [SQL Report Builder](../dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.md) gives you more flexibility when creating and structuring your charts - you can, for example, select what values should show on the X and Y axes. For more info on creating charts in the SQL Report Builder, check out our [Creating visualizations from SQL queries](../../tutorials/create-visuals-from-sql.md) tutorial.
