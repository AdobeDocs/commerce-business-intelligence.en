# Use SQL Report Builder

You can use the [SQL Report Builder](../dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.md) to directly query your data warehouse, view the results, and transform them into a chart. You can start creating a report with the SQL Report Builder by navigating to **Report Builder** > **SQL Report Builder**.

For more guidance on using the SQL Report Builder, see [Using the SQL Report Builder](../dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.md).
