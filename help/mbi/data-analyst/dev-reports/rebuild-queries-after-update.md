# Rebuilding Queries after the Update Cycle

You do not have to rebuild your queries. Reports created using the [`SQL Report Builder`](../dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.md) are saved like those created in the traditional `Report Builder`. The update process for SQL charts is the same - after your data is updated, the values in your charts will be recalculated and redisplayed.
