Understanding the coupon performance of your business is an interesting way to segment your orders and better understand customer habits.

We have documented the steps required to create this analysis to understand how coupon-acquired customers perform, see trends, and track individual coupon code usage.

#### Getting Started

First, a note about how coupon codes are tracked. If a customer applied a coupon to an order, three things happen:

* A discount is reflected in the `base_grand_total` amount (your <strong style="font-size: 13px;">Revenue </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">metric in MBI)</span>
* The coupon code is stored in the `coupon_code` field. If this field is NULL (empty) the order does not have a coupon associated with it.
* The discounted amount is stored in `base_discount_amount`. Depending on your configuration, this value may appear negative or positive.

## Building a Metric

The first step will be to construct a new metric with the following steps:</span>
* Navigate to **Manage Data &gt; Metrics &gt; Create New Metric**.
* Select the `sales_order` (if your store is on Magento 2) or `sales_flat_order` (if your store is on Magento 1) table.
* This metric performs a **Sum** on the **base_discount_amount** column, ordered by **created_at**.
  * FILTERS:
    * Add the **Orders we count (Saved Filter Set)**
    * Add the following:
      * `coupon_code`<strong> IS NOT </strong>`[NULL]`
    * Give the metric a name, such as **"Coupon discount amount"**.

## Creating your Dashboard

* Once the metric has been created:
  * Navigate to **Dashboards &gt; Dashboard Options &gt; Create New Dashboard**.
  * Give the dashboard a name such as **"Coupon Analysis"**.

* This will be where we create and add all the reports.

## Building Reports

* **New Reports:**
  * If you have not already, check out [this video][1] about using the Visual Report Builder to build charts, tables, and scalar values.
  * Note on **Time Period**: The time period for each report is listed as "All-time". Please feel free to alter this to suit your analysis needs. We recommend all reports on this dashboard cover the same time period, such as "All time", "Year-to-date", or "Last 365 days".
