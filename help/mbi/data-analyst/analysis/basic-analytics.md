Once you are familiar with the Magento BI platform and have a basic understanding of the tool, you are going to want to start building reports. One of the most common questions you may have is "What should I be looking at?"

The information below outlines some of the common metrics and reports you might find valuable. A number of these reports already exist within your account, so make sure you review the metrics and reports that exist within your account to avoid creating duplicates.

## Tables and columns you want to understand

When building a metric, you need to know four pieces of information:

1. The table the data lives on,
1. The specific action you want to perform,
1. The column you want to perform that action on, and
1. The timestamp you want to use for tracking that data.

Most likely, the names of the tables we use in these examples are slightly different from the column and table names in your database because each database is unique. Reference the below definitions if you need help identifying a corresponding table or column in your database.

## Customers table

This table contains the key information about each customer, such as a unique customer ID, email address, account creation date, and so on. In the examples below, we will use **customer_entity** as the name of a sample customer table.

If some of these calculations do not currently exist in your database, any admin user in your account can build them. Additionally, you want to make sure that these dimensions are groupable for all applicable metrics.

**Dimensions**

* **Entity_id**: A unique identifier for each customer. This may also be a unique customer number or a customer email address, and it should act as a reference key to your order's table.
* **Created_at**: The date the customer's account was created and added to your database.
* **Customer's lifetime revenue**: The total lifetime revenue generated by a customer.
* **Customer's first 30-day revenue**: The total amount of revenue generated by a customer in their first 30 days.
* **Customer's lifetime number of orders**: The number of orders placed by a customer over their lifetime.
* **Customer's lifetime number of coupons**: The total number of coupons used by a customer over their lifetime.
* **Customer's first order date**: The date of a customer's first order. This may be different from the created_at date if a customer did not place an order at the time of their creation.

***Do you accept guest orders?***

*If so, this table may not contain all of your customers. Contact our [support team](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016503692) to make sure your customer analyses include all customers.*

*Not sure if you accept guest orders? Refer to [this topic]({% link data-analyst/data-warehouse-mgr/guest-orders.md %}) to learn more!*

## Orders table

In this table, each row represents one order. The columns in this table contain basic information about each order, such as the order's ID, creation date, status, the ID of the customer who placed the order, and so on. In the examples below, we use **sales_flat_order** as the name of a sample orders table.

**Dimensions**

* **Customer_id**: A unique identifier for the customer who placed the order. This will often be used to move information between the customer and orders tables. In our examples, we expect the customer_id on the **sales_flat_order** table to align with the **entitiy_id** on the **customer_entity** table.
* **Created_at**: The date the order was created or placed.
* **Customer_email**: The email address of the customer who placed the order. This may also be the unique identifier for the customer.
* **Customer's lifetime number of orders**: A copy of the column with the same name on your Customers table.
* **Customer's order number**: The customer's sequential order number associated with the order. For example, if the row you are looking at is a customer's first order, this column is \"1\"; but, if this was the customer's 15th order, this column shows \"15\" for this order. If this dimension does not exist on your Customers table, ask our [support team](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016503692) to help you build it.
* **Customer's order number (previous-current)**: A concatenation of two values in the **Customer’s order number** column. It is used in a sample report below to display the elapsed time between any two orders. For example, the time between a customer’s first order date and their second order date is represented as “1-2” with this calculation.
* **Coupon_code**: Shows which coupon(s) were used on each order.
* **Seconds since previous order**: The time (in seconds) between a customer’s orders.

## Order Items table

In this table, each row represents one item that was sold. This table contains information about the items sold in each order, such as the order reference number, product number, quantity, and so on. In the examples below, we use **sales_flat_order_item** as the name of a sample order items table.

**Dimensions**

* **Item_id**: The unique identifier for each row in the table.
* **Order_id**: The reference key to your Orders table that tells you which items were purchased in the same order. If an order contains multiple items, this value is repeated.
* **Product_id**: If you want information about the specific product that was purchased (such as color, size, and so on), you would use this column to pull that information from your products table.
* **Order's created_at**: The timestamp that the order was placed, typically copied into your order line items table from the Orders table.
* **Order's coupon_code**: Similar to the **Order's created_at** dimension, this column is copied from your orders table.

## Subscriptions table

This table is used to manage your subscription information, such as subscription id, email address of the subscriber, subscription start date, and so on.

**Dimensions**

* **Customer_id**: A unique identifier for the customer who placed the order. This is a common way to build a path between the Customers table and the Orders table. In our examples, we expect the customer_id on the **sales_flat_order** table to align with the **entitiy_id** on the **customer_entity** table.
* **Start date**: The date a customer's subscription started.

## Marketing Spend table

When analyzing your marketing spend, you can include Facebook, Google AdWords, or other sources in your analyses. If you have multiple marketing spend sources, contact our [Magento Services Team](https://magento.com/services) for help setting up a consolidated table for your marketing campaigns.

**Dimensions**

* **Spend**: The total ad spend. In Facebook, this would be the spend column in the **facebook_ads_insights_####** table. For Google AdWords, this would be the adCost column in the **campaigns####** table.
* The "####" which is appended to each of these tables relates to the specific account ID for your Facebook or Google AdWords account.
* **Clicks**: The total number of clicks. In Facebook, this would be the clicks column in the **facebook_ads_insights_####** table. In Google AdWords, this would be the adClicks column in the **campaigns####** table.
* **Impressions**: The total number of impressions. In Facebook, this would be the impressions in the **facebook_ads_insights_####** table. In Google AdWords, this would be the impressions the **campaigns####** table.
* **Campaign**: The total number of clicks. In Facebook, this would be the campaign_name column in the **facebook_ads_insights_####** table. In Google AdWords, this would be the campaign column in the **campaigns####** table.
* **Date**: The timestamp that the spend, clicks, or impressions occurred for a particular campaign. In Facebook, this would be the date_start column in the **facebook_ads_insights_####** table. In Google AdWords, this would be the date column in the **campaigns####** table.
* **Customer's first order's source**: The order's source from a customer's first order. First, check to see if you have a column named customer's first order's source in your account. If you do not see this column, you can create the desired column using these instructions.
* **Customer's first order's medium**: The order's medium from a customer's first order. First, check to see if you have a column named customer's first order's source in your account. If you do not see this column, you can create the desired column using these instructions.
* **Customer's first order's campaign**: The order's campaign from a customer's first order. First, check to see if you have a column named customer's first order's source in your account. If you do not see this column, you can create the desired column using these instructions.

## Common reports and metrics

Here are some common examples of reports and metrics you might find useful:

* [Customer Analytics](#customeranalytics)
* [Order Analytics](#orderanalytics)
* [Marketing Spend Analytics](#mktgspendanalytics)

## Customer analytics {#customeranalytics}

### New users

* **Description**: A count of the total number of newly acquired users over a given period of time. **New Users** is different from **Unique Customers**, because **New Users** has the timestamp that an account was created with your service (this does not mean they necessarily placed an order) while **Unique Customers** have placed at least one order.
* **Metric Definition**: This metric performs a **Count** of **entity_id** from **customer_entity** table ordered by **created_at**.

* **Time Interval**: By Day

![New Users.]({% link images/New_Users_Last_Month.png %}){: width="929"}

### Unique customers

* **Description**: A count of the total number of distinct customers over a given period of time. This is different from **New Users**, because it only tracks customers who have placed at least one order. A distinct customers report will only track a customer once in a given time interval. If you set the time interval to By Day and a customer makes more than one purchase on that day, the customer will only be counted once. If you want to see a total number of purchases in general, look at **Number of Orders**.
* **Metric Definition**: This metric performs a **Count Distinct** of **customer_id** from **sales_flat_order** table ordered by **created_at**.
* **Report Example**: Distinct customers by week over the last 90 days
* **Metric**: Distinct Customers

![CAC 2]({% link images/CAC_2.png %}){: width="929"}

### Lifetime value by acquisition source, medium, and campaign

* **Description**: Alongside analyzing the number of customers acquired by each campaign, you can analyze the average lifetime revenue of these customers. This will help you identify:
   * If certain campaigns attract a large volume of customers, but those customers have a low lifetime value.
   * If certain campaigns attract a low volume of customers, but those customers have a high lifetime value.
* **Report Example**: To create this report, first add the New customers metric. Then, add the Average lifetime revenue metric. Select the desired time frame and choose the interval as None. Finally, select the group by option as Customer's first order's campaign.
   * **Metric A**: New Customers
   * **Filter A**: Customer's first order's source LIKE \'%google%\'
   * **Filter B**: Customer's first order's medium IN ppc
   * **Metric B**: Average lifetime revenue
   * **Filter A**: Customer's first order's source LIKE \'%google%\'
   * **Filter B**: Customer's first order's medium IN ppc
   * **Time Range**: All-Time
   * **Time Interval**: None
   * **Group By**: Customer's first order's campaign
   * **Notes**: For the two filters, you can add any other mediums that are considered \"paid\" mediums for your business such as cpc or paid search, and you can add any other sources you\'d like to analyze such as Facebook. Also, check out [this article]({% link data-analyst/analysis/roi-ad-camp.md %}) for more details on CAC, LTV, and ROI.

   ![Lifetime value by acquisition source, medium, and campaign]({% link images/LTV_2.png %}){: width="929"}

### Return on investment (ROI)

* **Description**: One way to calculate ROI by campaign is by analyzing all orders placed through the campaign. However, an alternate method is analyzing the lifetime value of customers acquired through a campaign. To analyze ROI, it is important that the campaign names are consistent across your spend data and transactional data. If you create the following report and there exist no ROI values due to mismatched campaign names, you may need to look into the [UTM tagging]({% link best-practices/utm-tagging-google.md %}) you have implemented.
* **Report Example**: ROI by campaign
   * **Metric A**: New Customers
   * **Filter A**: Customer's first order's source LIKE \'%google%\'
   * **Filter B**: Customer's first order's medium IN ppc
   * **Metric B**: Average lifetime revenue
   * **Filter A**: Customer's first order's source LIKE \'%google%\'
