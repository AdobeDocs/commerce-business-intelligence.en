Connecting your Salesforce data enables a range of analyses, from scoring and optimizing leads to hitting your goals for converted opportunities.

The Salesforce connector requires that you have [Salesforce API access](../integrations/salesforce.md) as part of your Salesforce subscription. Please verify this is enabled before getting started.

1. To add the Salesforce integration to your account, navigate to the Connections page under **Manage Data > Connections**.
1. Click **Add a Data Source**, located on the right side of the screen above the Data Sources table.
1. Click the Salesforce icon.
1. Click **Connect to Salesforce**.
1. Enter your Salesforce credentials and click **Login to Salesforce**.

That is it! After your credentials are validated, Salesforce setup will be complete.
