Connecting your Salesforce data enables a range of analyses, from scoring and optimizing leads to hitting your goals for converted opportunities.

1. Click the Add a Data Source button, located on the right side of the screen above the Data Sources table.
1. Click the Salesforce icon.
1. Click the Connect to Salesforce button.
1. Enter your Salesforce credentials and click the Login to Salesforce button.

That's it! After your credentials are validated, Salesforce setup will be complete.
