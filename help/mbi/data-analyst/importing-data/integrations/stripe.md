1. Click the **Stripe** icon. This will display the Stripe authorization page.
1. Click the **Connect with Stripe** button.

## Allow MBI access to your Stripe data {#steptwo}

After clicking the Connect with Stripe button, an access request page appears.

1. Click the **Sign in with Stripe to Continue** button.

1. Enter your credentials and click the Sign in to your account button.

1. After clicking the button, your credentials will be validated and you will be taken back to MBI.
