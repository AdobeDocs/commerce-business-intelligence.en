# Connect PrestaShop

Want to see how your business is performing or find your most valuable acquisition sources and channels? Connecting your PrestaShop data to [!DNL MBI] will allow you to answer these questions and more.

As PrestaShop's database is based on MySQL, you can connect it to [!DNL MBI] through a [direct connection](../integrations/mysql-via-a-direct-connection.md), [cPanel](../integrations/mysql-via-cpanel.md), or [via an SSH tunnel](../integrations/mysql-via-ssh-tunnel.md). We care about your data, so we recommend using the SSH method, as it is the most secure.
