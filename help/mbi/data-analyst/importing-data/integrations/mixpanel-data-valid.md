When Magento BI first connects to your Mixpanel data, your Account Manager or Analyst may request that you provide data exports from Mixpanel for validation purposes. This allows us to confirm that we have synced all the same data that is available to you directly within Mixpanel.

## Data export process: Events

1. Visit your **Segmentation** section and view **Your Top Events**.

1. Select **Past 96 Hours** for the time range

1. Scroll to the lower-right of the report and export a CSV:

1. Send the CSV file to the account manager or analyst you are working with on this validation process.
