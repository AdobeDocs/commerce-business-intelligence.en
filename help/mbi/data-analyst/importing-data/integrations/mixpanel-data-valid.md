# Data Validation in `Mixpanel`

When [!DNL MBI] first connects to your [!DNL Mixpanel] data, your Account Manager or Analyst may request that you provide data exports from Mixpanel for validation purposes. This allows us to confirm that we have synced all the same data that is available to you directly within [!DNL Mixpanel].

## Data export process: `Events`

1. Visit your `Segmentation` section and view `Your Top Events`.

1. Scroll to the lower-right of the report and export a `.csv` file:

1. Send the `.csv` file to the account manager or analyst you are working with on this validation process.
