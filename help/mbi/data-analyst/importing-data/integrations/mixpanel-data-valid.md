# Data Validation in `Mixpanel`

When [!DNL MBI] first connects to your [!DNL Mixpanel] data, your Account Manager or Analyst may request that you provide data exports from Mixpanel for validation purposes. This allows you to confirm that you have synced all the same data that is available to you directly within [!DNL Mixpanel].

## Data export process: `Events`

1. Visit your `Segmentation` section and view `Your Top Events`.
