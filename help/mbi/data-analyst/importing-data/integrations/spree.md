# Connect Spree

Want to see how your business is performing or find your most valuable acquisition sources and channels? Connecting your Spree data to [!DNL MBI] will allow you to answer these questions and more.

As Spree's database is based on PostgreSQL, you can connect it to [!DNL MBI] using the [same steps that you would for a normal Postgres connection](../integrations/postgresql.md).
