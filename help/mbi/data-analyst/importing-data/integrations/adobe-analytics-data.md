# Expected [!DNL Adobe Analytics] Data

The [!DNL Adobe Analytics] integration for [!DNL MBI] uses the [Analytics 2.0 Reporting API](https://developer.adobe.com/analytics-apis/docs/2.0/#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/README.md).

>[!INFO]
>
>To ensure you obtain the data you expect, you can first build a report in the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] Workspace with your desired metrics and dimensions. This allows you to check for compatibility and availability of data.

One table per connected report suite – called `report-suite-<ID>`, where `<ID>` is a unique ID generated by [!DNL MBI] – will be created in your Data Warehouse.

The schema of this table is composed of the metrics and dimensions you selected in the integration setup process. Several additional columns are also be generated by [!DNL MBI], for identification purposes.

For example, if you selected the following metric and dimension during setup:
- `Metric`: `Page views`
- `Dimension`: `Page`

The table would contain these columns:

| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `_id` | This column is the primary key. |
| `_item_hash` | [!DNL MBI] unique identifier. This column is created by [!DNL MBI].|
| `_updated_at` | This column contains the last time the data row was updated. It is created by [!DNL MBI].|
| `start_date` | Start date of included data for the row. `start_date` will always be 00:00 of the same day within one row.|
| `end_date` | End date of included data for the row. `end_date` will always be 23:59 of the same day within one row.|
| `page_views` | Selected metric: The total number of page views for the identified time period.|
| `page` | Selected dimension: Individual page names with tracked views.|

Control which of the selected metrics and dimensions have data available in your [!DNL MBI] table by using the *sync* or *unsync* options in the `Data Warehouse` page. Columns not currently being synced appear in gray. If you stop syncing a column, you can begin syncing it again later.

## Current Limitations

This section outlines limitations of the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] integration for [!DNL MBI].

| Limitation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Historical data period` | As with other third-party integrations, the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] integration pulls a limited amount of historical data and then continues to keep data updated. The historical period is configured to 2 weeks. |
| `Empty component combinations` | Some combinations of metrics and dimensions contain no data. If such a combination is selected for replication, [!DNL MBI] excludes the column from the replicated table. To avoid selecting such a combination, you can first create a report in the [[!DNL Adobe Analytics] Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html?lang=en) to verify you will get the data you expect. |
| `Re-authorization cadence` | Re-authorization of the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] integration is currently required every two weeks. To re-authorize, go to the Edit page for the integration and click **[!UICONTROL Re-Authorize with [!DNL Adobe Analytics]]**. |
| `One dimension per row` | [!DNL Adobe Analytics] provides metric data for one dimension at a time. If you select multiple dimensions during setup, each row in your [!DNL MBI] table will contain a single dimension value and nulls for each other dimension. |
