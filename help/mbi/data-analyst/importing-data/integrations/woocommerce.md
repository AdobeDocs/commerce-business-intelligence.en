Want to see how your business is performing or find your most valuable acquisition sources and channels? Connecting your WooCommerce data to MBI will allow you to answer these questions and more.

As WooCommerce's database is based on MySQL, you can connect it to MBI through a [direct connection](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-a-direct-connection.md), [cPanel](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-cpanel.md), or [via an SSH tunnel](../data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-ssh-tunnel.md). We care about your data, so we recommend using the SSH method, as it's the most secure.
