# Audit [!DNL Google Adwords] data

Found something strange in [[!DNL Google Adwords]](../integrations/google-adwords.md)? To pinpoint the issue, you will need to explore your data. This can be done by exporting your [!DNL Google Adwords] data to a `.csv` file.

1. Download and install the free [[!DNL Google Adwords] Editor](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/ads-editor/) application.
1. After installation is complete, select `Add Count` in the `Add/manage accounts` panel.
1. Enter your [!DNL Google Adwords] account information.
1. After your account is added to [!DNL Google Adwords] Editor, select **[!UICONTROL File** > **Export Spreadsheet (CSV)** > **Export Whole Account]**

This will build a `.csv` file containing all information stored in your current [!DNL Google Adwords] account. At this point, submit a support ticket (be sure to attach this file!) so we can take a closer look at your data. If the file is too large, share it with the [!DNL MBI] team via [!DNL Dropbox] or [!DNL Google Drive].

For more information about [!DNL Google Adwords] `.csv` file exports, refer to the official [[!DNL Google Adwords] documentation](https://support.google.com/adwords/editor/answer/38657?hl=en).
