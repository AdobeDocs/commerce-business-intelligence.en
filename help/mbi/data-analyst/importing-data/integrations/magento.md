Want to see how your business is performing or find your most valuable acquisition sources and channels? Connecting your Magento data to Magento BI will allow you to answer these questions and more.

As Magento\'s database is based on MySQL, you can connect it to Magento BI through a [direct connection]({% link data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-a-direct-connection.md %}), [cPanel]({% link data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-cpanel.md %}), or [via an SSH tunnel]({% link data-analyst/importing-data/integrations/mysql-via-ssh-tunnel.md %}). We care about your data, so we recommend using the SSH method, as it\'s the most secure.
