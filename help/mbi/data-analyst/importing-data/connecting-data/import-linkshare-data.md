To bring your Linkshare data into Magento BI, you'll need to do two things:

1. [Export the Linkshare data in CSV format](../#export)
1. [Upload the spreadsheet into Magento BI](../data-analyst/importing-data/connecting-data/using-file-uploader.md)

## Export data from Linkshare {#export}

1. In your Linkshare account, go to **Reports > Run Reports.**

1. In the **Report** drop-down, select **Sales & Activity Report**.

1. Leave all other drop-down options as the default selection.

1. In the **Date Range** drop-down, select whichever option (Sun - Sat, Mon - Sun) matches with your Start of Week settings in Magento BI.

1. Clear the **Compare Year-Over-Year Data** checkbox.

1. Under **Data Type**, select **Transaction Date**.

1. Click **View Report**.

1. Click the **Download** button.

   At this point, a CSV file will be created and downloaded.

After the file is downloaded, you can upload it to Magento BI using the [File Upload feature](../data-analyst/importing-data/connecting-data/using-file-uploader.md).
