If you want to view the data behind a chart, click the gear icon in the top-right corner of any chart.

Select either:

- **Report Export**
- **Full CSV Export**
- **Full Excel Export**
- **Raw Export**

You can also define the [table and columns you want to include in the export](../../tutorials/export-raw-data.md).

If you need to include a chart in a presentation or document, you can export the chart as an image in PNG, PDF, or SVG format by clicking the gear icon in the top-right corner of any chart. Select the `Enlarge` option in the drop-down, and then click the download button to complete the export.
