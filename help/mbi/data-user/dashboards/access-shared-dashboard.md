# Access shared dashboards

Getting new users up to speed is simple.

## New User

After a new user creates their password, a list of popular shared dashboards will display. They can select the dashboards they want to show on their dashboard and click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

## Existing Users

To view the list of shared dashboards again, users can click **[!UICONTROL Find]** in the `Global Search` menu.
