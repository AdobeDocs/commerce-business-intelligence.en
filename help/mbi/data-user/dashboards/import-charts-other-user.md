You may want to edit a chart that another user owns, or create something similar. For this, we have made it easy to import a chart that another user currently owns and save it in your own dashboard.

## Find the chart

First find the chart which you want to copy from the other user. All the dashboards that are shared with you can be found in the **Dashboard** sidebar where they are marked with a shared icon. Click the desired dashboard.

## Clone the chart

In the shared dashboard, pick the chart that you want to copy to your own account. Click the **gear** (![](../../assets/gear-icon.png)) icon and then click **Save As**.

You will then be prompted to name your copy of the chart, and add it to any of your existing dashboards. If you do not select a dashboard, it will be added to your list of existing charts and you can [add it later](../../data-user/dashboards/add-charts-dashboard.md).
