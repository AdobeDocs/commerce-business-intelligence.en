# Remove a chart from a dashboard

To remove a chart from a dashboard, click the **gear** (![](../../mbi/assets/gear-icon.png)) icon in the top-right corner of the chart and click **Remove from Dashboard**.

**Note**: Removing a chart is not the same as [deleting it](../../data-user/dashboards/delete-chart.md){: target="_blank"}. Additionally, [a chart can be re-added to a dashboard](../../data-user/dashboards/add-charts-dashboard.md){: target="_blank"} at any time.
