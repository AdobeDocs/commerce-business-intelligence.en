# Share dashboards with other users

Sharing dashboards is a great way to keep your team in the loop and encourage collaborative discussion. By creating and sharing a central dashboard, you can provide your team with the information they need while still maintaining control. [We recommend](../../best-practices/share-dashboard-best-practice.md){: target="_blank"} that you grant Edit rights to a select few to minimize accidental changes.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the dashboard you are sharing contains reports built with metrics that a specific user does not have access to, the reports display an **Error Loading Data** message. If you want the data to appear to the specific user, an [admin user](../../administrator/user-management/user-management.md) must grant access to all metrics used in those reports.

## Share a dashboard

1. Click the **Share Dashboard** button at the top of the screen.

   A list of all users in your Magento Business Intelligence account will display.

1. To select a user to share the dashboard with, check the box to the left of their name.

   To select/deselect all users, click the **Select** button and select `Everyone` or `None`, respectively.

1. Permissions can be set on a user-by-user basis or en masse.

    **To set individual permissions**, click **None** to the right of the user's name. From this dropdown, select the type of permissions the user should have.

    **To set permissions en masse**, click the **Set Permissions** button. From this drop-down, select the type of permissions the selected users should have.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You can also use this feature to update previously set permissions. For example, if you want to stop sharing the dashboard with someone, set their permissions to `None`.

1. To share the dashboard, click the **Save Changes** button. The selected user(s) will receive an email inviting them to view the dashboard.
