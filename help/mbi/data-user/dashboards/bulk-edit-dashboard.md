# Bulk editing Charts in Dashboards

The bulk-editing feature makes it easy to change chart names and dates in your dashboards. For example, you want all charts on a specific dashboard to refer to a single store and report on a monthly basis rather than quarterly. Rather than changing everything manually, let the bulk-editing feature do the work. In this article, you will learn how to use:

* [The Find/Replace Feature](#findreplace)

* [The Prepend Name Feature](#prepend)

* [The Change Dates Feature](#dates)

That being said, consider this - **Do these changes need to be permanent?** If not, consider cloning the dashboard and then changing the dates in the new dashboard. This will allow you to preserve your original dashboard while still making the changes you need.
