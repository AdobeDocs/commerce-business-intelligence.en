# Bulk editing Charts in Dashboards

The bulk-editing feature makes it easy to change chart names and dates in your dashboards. For example, you want all charts on a specific dashboard to refer to a single store and report on a monthly basis rather than quarterly. Rather than changing everything manually, let the `bulk-editing` feature do the work. In this topic, you learn how to use:

* [The [!DNL Find/Replace] Feature](#findreplace)

* [The [!DNL Prepend Name] Feature](#prepend)

* [The [!DNL Change Dates] Feature](#dates)

That being said, consider this - *Do these changes need to be permanent?* If not, consider cloning the dashboard and then changing the dates in the new dashboard. This allows you to preserve your original dashboard while still making the changes you need.
