In **Manage Data** > **Dashboards**, you can manage user permissions for dashboards you own, delete dashboards you no longer need, and set a default dashboard. Here is a quick look at what we cover in this article:

1. [Renaming dashboards](#rename)

1. [Managing dashboard permissions](#userperm)

1. [Changing the default dashboard](#default)

1. [Deleting dashboards](#delete)

## Rename a Dashboard {#rename}

To rename a dashboard:

1. Click the name of the dashboard you want to change.

2. Enter the new name in the **Dashboard Name** field.

## Manage User Permissions {#userperm}

Three levels of access exist in MBI for dashboards - View, Edit, and None.

* **View** allows selected users to view the dashboard but not edit it. Users can also resize charts, export data, and copy the charts onto their own dashboards using the Save As function if they have Standard or Admin permissions.

* **Edit** allows selected users to edit and save charts to this dashboard if they have Standard or Admin permissions. Also, users with Edit permissions can also share dashboards with other users.

* **None** means selected users cannot view or edit this dashboard.

User permissions can be changed one of two ways - for all users or for an individual user.

1. **To change all users' permissions,** use the drop-down menu next to the **Set all users' permissions toâ€¦** label.

1. **To change an individual user's permissions,** use the drop-down menu next to the user's name to set the desired level of access.

## Change the Default Dashboard {#default}

To change your default dashboard for the account:

1. Click the name of the dashboard you want as your default.

1. Click the **Make Default** button.

## Delete Dashboards {#delete}

To delete a dashboard:

1. Click the name of the dashboard you want to delete.

1. Click the **Delete Dashboard** button.
