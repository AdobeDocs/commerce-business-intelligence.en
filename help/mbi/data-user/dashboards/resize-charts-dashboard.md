# Working with charts in dashboards

Scalar numbers. Bar graphs. Charts extending over long periods. Every chart displays information differently, meaning the size and location of charts is not a one-size-fits-all solution. In [!DNL MBI], you can resize and rearrange charts to create your ideal workspace.

*To resize a chart*, click and drag the bottom-right corner of any chart.

*To move a chart*, hover over the top of the chart until the `Move` cursor displays. Click and hold, then drag the chart to the desired location. Release click to place the chart.
