Scalar numbers. Bar graphs. Charts extending over long periods. Every chart displays information differently, meaning the size and location of charts is not a one-size-fits-all solution. In Magento BI, you can resize and rearrange charts to create your ideal workspace.

**To resize a chart**, click and drag the bottom-right corner of any chart.

**To move a chart**, hover over the top of the chart until the \'Move\' cursor displays. Click and hold, then drag the chart to the desired location. Release to place the chart.
