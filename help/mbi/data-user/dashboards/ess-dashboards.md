title: Dashboards

MBI Dashboards give you a quick view of your store's performance and sales activity at a glance. Individual dashboards can be shared with other users and organized into logical groups. You can also set different levels of permission for other users.

It's easy to create a new report, add it to a dashboard, and export the data to Excel. Charts and reports can be resized and dragged into position on the dashboard.

## Creating dashboards {#createdash}

Dashboards are essentially sharable, themed buckets for the analyses you create in the Report Builders. This is how you can encourage your team to collaborate and maintain a single source of truth across your organization.

**If you are an Admin or a Standard user**, you can create a dashboard by clicking the Dashboard Options drop-down and choosing **Create New dashboard**.

What the dashboards you create look like is entirely up to you. You can arrange and resize the elements in the dashboard any way you wish to suit your needs and workflow.

## Arrange items on a dashboard

* To resize a chart or report, drag the lower-right corner to the new size.

* To move a chart or report, hover over the title or header until the cursor changes to a cross. Then, drag it into position.

## Managing your dashboards {#managedash}

In **Manage Data** > **Dashboards**, you can manage user permissions for dashboards you own, delete dashboards you no longer need, and set a default dashboard.

#### Sharing your dashboards {#sharingdash}

To truly scale MBI throughout your organization and provide valuable insights, we encourage you to share dashboards you create with other team members. **You can share dashboards you own** by clicking the **Share Dashboard** option at the top of the page.

When you share a dashboard, you can assign permissions across your organization OR on an individual basis, meaning you get to decide who can view and edit your reports.

**Note**: Read Only users only have access to dashboards that are directly shared with them - they are not able to search for and add dashboards on their own. do not forget to keep them in the loop!

#### Accessing shared dashboards {#accessshared}

**If you are an Admin or Standard user** and want to add a shared dashboard to your account, you can do so by clicking **Dashboard Options** and then clicking **Find** in the dropdown.
