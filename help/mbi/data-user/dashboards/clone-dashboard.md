Cloning a dashboard allows you to copy all reports in a dashboard into a new dashboard.

This is particularly useful if you want to re-create an existing set of charts but change the perspective (e.g., different data view, different market, different website or store). After duplicating the dashboard, you can edit each of the new charts to change its metric, data view, filter, or group-by.

1. To clone a dashboard, click the **Options** menu at the top of the screen.

1. In the drop-down menu, click **Save As**.

1. When prompted, enter the **New Dashboard Name**. We recommend names that tell you, at a glance, what information is contained in the dashboard.

   Lets say, for example, that you are cloning a dashboard named `Customer Activity`. This dashboard contained customer activity information for your Philadelphia location, but now you want to create a dashboard for your new New York City location. This dashboard could be named `New York City - Customer Activity`.

1. Use the **Chart Title Find** and **Chart Title Replace** fields to find all charts with `Philadelphia` in the title and replace it with `New York City`.

   If you donâ€™t enter any values in these fields, a `(2)` will automatically be appended at the end of all chart titles in the new dashboard.

1. Click the **Save** button to clone the dashboard.

Example:

![clone dashboard]({% link images/datgif.gif %})
