# Clone a Dashboard

Cloning a dashboard allows you to copy all reports in a dashboard into a new dashboard.

This is useful if you want to re-create an existing set of charts but change the perspective (for example, different data view, different market, different website or store). After duplicating the dashboard, you can edit each of the new charts to change its metric, data view, filter, or group-by.

1. To clone a dashboard, click **[!UICONTROL Options]** at the top of the screen.

1. In the dropdown , click **[!UICONTROL Save As]**.

1. When prompted, enter the `New Dashboard Name`. Adobe recommends names that tell you, at a glance, what information is contained in the dashboard.

   For example, you are cloning a dashboard named `Customer Activity`. This dashboard contained customer activity information for your Philadelphia location, but now you want to create a dashboard for your new New York City location. This dashboard could be named `New York City - Customer Activity`.

1. Use the `Chart Title Find` and `Chart Title Replace` fields to find all charts with `Philadelphia` in the title and replace it with `New York City`.

   If you do not enter any values in these fields, a `(2)` automatically appends at the end of all chart titles in the new dashboard.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to clone the dashboard.
