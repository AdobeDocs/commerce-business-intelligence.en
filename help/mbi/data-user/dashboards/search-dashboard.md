In this article, we'll show you how to use the [Global Search feature](../#global) to look for dashboards and how to search for [dashboards owned by other users](../#other).

## Global Search {#global}

The Global Search menu allows you to search for and select dashboards to view.

* **To view a list of your existing dashboards**, click the dashboard drop-down menu.

* **To search for a dashboard**, type in some search criteria in the search bar after clicking the dashboard drop-down menu. If any dashboards match the criteria, they'll display first in the list.

Example:

## Find Dashboards Owned by Other Users {#other}

Looking for a dashboard owned by another user? If the dashboard can be viewed by others, you can search for it by clicking **Find** in the **Dashboard Options** drop-down.
