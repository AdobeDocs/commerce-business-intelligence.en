# Add Charts to Dashboards

Existing charts can be added to dashboards using the `Add Report` function, located in the top-right area of the screen. The same chart can be added to multiple dashboards, meaning if the chart is edited, all dashboards with this chart will reflect the change.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Clicking **[!UICONTROL Add Report]** is not the same as clicking **[!UICONTROL Save As]** in the chart editor. `Add Report` merely adds the chart to the dashboard whereas, `Save As` creates a new version of an existing chart.

## Add a chart

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Report]**. A list of existing charts will display.

1. Search for or click the name of the chart you want to add.

1. The chart will be added to the dashboard.

Example:

![add chart](../../assets/sql-integration-encrypted-yes.png)
