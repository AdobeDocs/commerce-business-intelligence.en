# Add Charts to Dashboards

Existing charts can be added to dashboards using the **Add Report** button in the top-right area of the screen. The same chart can be added to multiple dashboards, meaning if the chart is edited, all dashboards with this chart will reflect the change.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Clicking the **Add Report** button is not the same as using the **Save As** function in the chart editor. The **Add Report** button merely adds the chart to the dashboard whereas the **Save As** function creates a new version of an existing chart.

## Add a chart

1. Click the **Add Report** button. A list of existing charts will display.

1. Search for or click the name of the chart you want to add.

1. The chart will be added to the dashboard.

Example:
