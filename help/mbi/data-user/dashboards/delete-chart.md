To permanently delete a chart:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Charts]**.

1. The charts you can delete (based on user permissions and chart ownership) display on the right side of the screen.

1. Click the checkbox next to the chart line that you want to delete.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete Selected]**.

   >[!NOTE]

   >If the chart is being used in a dashboard or email summary, a notification displays. To continue, you must confirm the deletion and then click **[!UICONTROL Force Deletion]**.
