# Delete a dashboard

If you want to keep your dashboard list from becoming too cluttered, you can delete a dashboard if it is no longer required. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:

1. [Via the Account Settings page](../#account) - this method [requires Admin permissions](../../administrator/user-management/user-management.md)

1. [Via the Dashboard Options menu](../#DO) - this method requires you to own the dashboard or have Edit permissions.

## Delete Dashboard via the Account Settings page {#account}

1. Click **Account Settings** > **Dashboards**.

1. In the list of dashboards, click the dashboard you want to delete.

1. Click the **Delete Dashboard** button.

Example:

![delete dashboard](../../assets/deleting_dash.gif)<!--{: width="703" height="346"}-->

## Delete Dashboard via the Dashboard Options menu {#DO}

1. Click the **Dashboard Options** menu at the top of the screen.

1. In the dropdown, click **Delete**.

1. When prompted to confirm, click the **Delete** button.

Example:

![delete dashboard](../../assets/deleting_dash_2.gif)<!--{: width="703" height="347"}-->
