# Formulas

A formula combines multiple metrics and mathematical logic to answer a question. For example, how much of the revenue per product during the holiday season was generated by new customers?

## Step 1: Create the Basic Report

1. In the menu, choose `Report Builder`.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Metric]** and choose the first metric for the report.

    For this example, the `Revenue by products ordered` metric is used.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Metric]** again and choose the second metric for the report.

    For this example, the `New Customers` metric is used.

1. In the sidebar, click **[!UICONTROL Details]** to display information about each metric.

1. To return to your report, click the previous browser tab.

1. In the chart, hover over a few data points on each line to see the amounts associated with each metric.

## Step 2: Add a Formula

1. At the top of the sidebar, click **[!UICONTROL Add Formula]**.

    The formula box shows the metrics as available inputs `A` and `B`, and includes an input box where you can enter the formula.

    Do the following:

    * In the `Enter your Formul` input box, enter `A/B`.

        This will divide the revenue by products ordered by the number of new customers.

    * Set `Select format` to `123Number`.

    * In the sidebar, replace `Untitled` with a name for the formula.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

    The report now has a new line for the formula, `New Customer Revenue`, and the sidebar shows the total amount of revenue generated by new customers.

## Step 3: Add a Date Range

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Date Range]** in the upper-right corner.

1. On the `Fixed Date Range` tab, do the following:

    * On the calendars, choose the date range.

        For this example, the holiday season is from November 1 through December 31.

    * Under `Select Time Interval`, choose `Day`.

        ![Fixed Date Range](../../assets/magento-bi-report-builder-revenue-by-products-formula-report-fixed-date-range.png)

    * When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

    The report is now limited to the holiday season, with a data point for each day.

## Step 4: Save the Report

In this step, you will save the report as a chart and also as a table.

1. Click `Untitled Report` at the top of the page and enter a descriptive title. For this example, the report title is `2017 Holiday Sales`.

    Then, do the following:

    * In the upper-right corner, Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

    * For `Type`, accept the default `Chart` setting.

    * Choose the `Dashboard` where the report is to be available.

    * Click **[!UICONTROL Save to Dashboard]**.

1. Click the report title and change the name. For this example, the report title is changed to `2017 Holiday Sales Data`.

    Then, do the following:

    * In the upper-right corner, click **[!UICONTROL Save a Copy]**.

    * Set `Type` to `Table`.

    * Choose the `Dashboard` where the report is to be available.

    * Click **[!UICONTROL Save a Copy to Dashboard]**.

1. To see the reports in your dashboard, do one of the following:

    * Click **[!UICONTROL Go to Dashboard]** in the message at the top of the page.

    * In the menu, choose **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]**. Click the name of the current dashboard to display the list. Then, click the name of the dashboard where the report was saved.
