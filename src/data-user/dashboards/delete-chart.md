Even if you [remove a chart from the dashboard]({% link data-user/dashboards/remove-charts-dashboard.md %}){: target="_blank"}, it still exists in your Magento BI account. To permanently delete a chart:

1. Click the **Account Settings** tab in the sidebar.

1. Click the **Charts** option.

1. The charts you have the ability to delete (based on user permissions and chart ownership) will display on the right side of the screen.

1. Click the checkbox next to the chart you want to delete.

1. Click the **Delete Selected** button.

   **Note**: If the chart is being used in a dashboard, email summary, etc., a notification will display. To continue, you must confirm the deletion and then click the **Force Deletion** button.

Example:

![delete a chart]({% link images/deletechart.gif %}){: width="630" height="402"}
